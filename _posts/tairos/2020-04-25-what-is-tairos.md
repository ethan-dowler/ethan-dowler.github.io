## The Three Pillars of Tairos

Tairos is built on three core concepts.

It's a **cooperative**, **monster-fighting**, **multi-classing** card game.

### Cooperative

You and a party of players work **together** to defend the kingdom of Tairos. It is in your best interest to support your allies and make sure you're all equiped for the fight. If a player is eliminated, you will have to continue without them, making things much harder for yourself!

### Monster-Fighting

You will engage with a variety of fantasy-inspired monsters sent to destroy everything you hold dear. Each enemy will approach the battle differently, so you will have to adapt quickly or risk falling behind. With a wide array of threats, no single strategy will lead to victory every time.

### Multi-Classing

Each player will choose **two** class decks, and on each turn, they will have to choose which deck they want to draw from. By mixing and matching different combinations, you can experience a plethora of play-styles.

Want to punch things **and** wield magic? Try combining the *Brawler* and the *Arcanist*. Do you prefer to fight from a distance? Switch out the *Brawler* for the *Ranger*. With *Tairos*'s unique, multi-classing system, you'll always have a new combination of classes to explore.
