This is where I will record my adventure of creating the card game Tairos.

To be honest, it really should be "Tairos 32: Finally making a blog" because I have been working on this for quite a while now. I have gotten the game into a playable state. My main goal now is to start spreading the word! Which is why I'm starting this blog series now.

If you would like to stay informed about the development of Tairos, follow this blog series! An mailing list is in the works (if it is not on the site already), so you will be able to subscribe to get emailed whenever a new article is released.

Thank you for considering following my journey!
