## I'm Writing a Book!

Hello friends. This is not the first crazy, creative idea I've had, but it's the latest (as of this writing).

One of the things on my bucket list that I've yet to check off is "write a book," so I'm starting the long journey of writing NOW.

Well, actually, I started it last year, but now I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to start sharing it and getting feedback!

That's where YOU come in.

Please enjoy this content as a sort of "pre-alpha" phase of my book and share your thoughts with me.

The working title is _**Break of Dawne**_ (yes, that's with an "e"!).

## The Premise

Joye Dawne, along with her sisters, Sorrowe and Hope, suffer from an ancestral curse, passed down through their father, that gives them curled horns, pointed tails, and gray skin. That never mattered to them because they're family was united and thriving â€” until their parents mysteriously disappeared in a terrible storm. If that wasn't enough, a primitive tribe of brutes invaded their homeland and started making life difficult. The three sisters search for meaning and purpose in their new reality, each in their own way.

## Goals

I want to write a story that:

- entertains high fantasy yet feels very human
- juxtaposes the consequences of sin with the peace of forgiveness
- evokes emotion and feeling
- makes you want to change for the better
