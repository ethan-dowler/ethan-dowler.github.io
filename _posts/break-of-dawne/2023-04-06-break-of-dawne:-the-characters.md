### Joye (19)

As the first-born child, Joye takes it upon herself to look after her sisters. She enjoys order and logic, which she puts to practice in her magic. As a fledgling wizard, Joye uses her growing magical powers to protect and provide for her family. Joye always finds the silver lining. She won't let a few tragedies keep her down. She can't afford to. Her sisters need her to be a strong leader.

### Sorrowe (16)

Being the middle child is tough, especially when you're the only member of your family who can't use magic. Physically gifted and martially talented, Sorrowe prefers to solve problems with her bare hands. Her blunt and sassy attitude may be the source of a lot of arguments, but no one can argue with her results. She'll never back down from a challenge, and she won't let her sisters out-do her just because she doesn't have magic!
