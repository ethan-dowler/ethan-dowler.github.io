## The Dawne Sisters
### Joye (19)

As the first-born child, Joye takes it upon herself to look after her sisters. She enjoys order and logic, which she puts to practice in her study of magic. As a fledgling wizard, Joye uses her growing magical powers to protect and provide for her family. Joye always finds the silver lining. She won't let a few tragedies keep her down. She can't afford to. Her sisters need her to be a strong leader.

### Sorrowe (16)

Being the middle child is tough, especially when you're the only member of your family who can't use magic. Physically gifted and martially talented, Sorrowe prefers to solve problems with her bare hands. Her blunt and sassy attitude may be the source of a lot of arguments, but no one can argue with her results. She'll never back down from a challenge, and she won't let her sisters out-do her just because she doesn't have magic!

### Hope (13)

Hope has a knack for putting things back together. Not just with her magical mending abilites, but also with her gentle and soothing attitude. Born with a font of magic in her blood, Hope is still learning to control her abilites. She would love to become a master of magic, but first she'd love it if her sisters would just stop fighting! She's the balm of peace that keeps her family together.

## The Rockbitter Clan

### Waruk (24)

As the son of the chief, Waruk bears the heavy expectations of his father. He's lived up to those expectations so far, but the recent events surrounding his clan's descent from the mountians to the plains turned his world upside down. He'll have to carve a new path for himself and his people. Unfortunately, the Dawne sisters are in his way.

### Dorgu (39)

Dorgu strong, but Dorgu not too smart. Dorgu serve clan. Clan is family. Clan is home. Dorgu defend family and home. Nothing stop Dorgu! Maybe one thing stop Dorgu. Dorgu not know why little demon girls act funny. They name is Done? Rockbitter better name than Done. No matter to Dorgu. Dorgu serve clan. Clan is family. Clan is home.
