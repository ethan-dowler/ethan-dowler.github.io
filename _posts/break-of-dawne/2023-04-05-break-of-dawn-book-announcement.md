### I'm Writing a Book!

Hello friends. This is not the first crazy, creative idea I've had, but it's the latest (as of this writing).

One of the things on my bucket list that I've yet to check off is "write a book," so I'm starting the long journey of writing NOW.

Well, actually, I started it last year, but now I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to start sharing it and getting feedback!

That's where YOU come in.

Please enjoy this content as a sort of "pre-alpha" phase of my book and share your thoughts with me.

### Goals

I want to write a story that is fantastical yet very human.

I want to write a story that explores the weight of our sin and the peace of forgiveness.
