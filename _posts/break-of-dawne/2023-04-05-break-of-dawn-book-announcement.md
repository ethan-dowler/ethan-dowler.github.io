## I'm Writing a Book!

Hello friends. This is not the first crazy, creative idea I've had, but it's the latest (as of this writing).

One of the things on my bucket list that I've yet to check off is "write a book," so I'm starting the long journey of writing NOW.

Well, actually, I started it last year, but now I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to start sharing it and getting feedback!

That's where YOU come in.

Please enjoy this content as a sort of "pre-alpha" phase of my book and share your thoughts with me.

The working title is _**Break of Dawne**_ (yes, that's with an "e"!).

## The Premise

Joye Dawne, along with her sisters, Sorrowe and Hope, suffer from an ancestral curse. Their family thrived on the Bellwind Plains until their parents mysteriously disappeared after a terrible storm.

Now, a primitive, brutish tribe has invaded the Dawne sisters' homeland and is making life difficult.

The three sisters each try to find meaning and purpose in this new, upside-down wold in different ways.

## The Characters

### Joye (19)

As the first-born child, Joye takes it upon herself to look after her sisters. She enjoys order and logic, which she puts to practice in her magic. As a fledgling wizard, Joye uses her growing magical powers to protect and provide for her family. Joye always finds the silver lining. She won't let a few tragedies keep her down. She can't afford to. Her sisters need her to be a strong leader.

### Sorrowe (16)

Being the middle child is tough, especially when you're the only member of your family who can't use magic. Physically gifted and martially talented, Sorrowe prefers to solve problems with her bare hands. Her blunt and sassy attitude may be the source of a lot of arguments, but no one can argue with her results. She'll never back down from a challenge, and she won't let her sisters out-do her just because she doesn't have magic!

### Hope (13)

_TODO_

## Goals

I want to write a story that:

- entertains high fantasy yet feels very human
- juxtaposes the consequences of sin with the peace of forgiveness
- evokes emotion and feeling
