This is where I will record my adventure of creating the card game Tairos.

To be honest, it really should be "Tairos 32: Finally making a blog" because I have been working on the game for quite a while now. I have gotten into into a playable state, so my main goal now is to start spreading the word! Which is why I'm starting this blog series now.

Thank you for considering following my journey!
